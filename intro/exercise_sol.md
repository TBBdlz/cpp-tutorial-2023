# Exercise solution

## Convert other based number to based 10

convert number to based 10 number

1. 1001101 based 2
run python3 `int('1001101', base=2)` results in `77`

2. 127 based 8
run python3 `int('127', base=8)` results in `87`

3. 12AF based 16
run python3 `int('12AF', base=16)` results in `4783`

5. 12121 based 3
run python3 `int('12121', base=3)` results in `151`

6. 1632 based 7
run python3 `int('1632', base=7)` results in `660`

## Convert based n to based m

1. 10110001010 based 2 to based 16
run python3 `hex(int('10110001010', base=2))` results in `0x58a`

2. 13263 based 7 to based 3
run python3 `base3 = int('13263', base=7)` results in `3573`
and 3573 based 10 to based 3 -> 11220100 based 3
